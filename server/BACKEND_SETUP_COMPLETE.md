# KLHConnect Backend - Complete Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Backend Structure Created

### Database Models (MongoDB with Mongoose)
All models created with proper relationships and validations:

1. **User Model** (`models/User.js`)
   - Fields: name, email, password (hashed), studentId, role, department, year, phone, profilePicture, bio
   - Relationships: registeredClubs[], registeredEvents[]
   - Methods: comparePassword(), getSignedJwtToken()
   - Roles: student, faculty, admin

2. **Event Model** (`models/Event.js`)
   - Fields: title, description, fullDescription, date, time, venue, category, poster, organizer, eligibility, prerequisites, maxCapacity
   - Relationships: registeredUsers[] (with registration data), createdBy (User)
   - Methods: isFull()
   - Text search index on title, description, tags

3. **Club Model** (`models/Club.js`)
   - Fields: name, description, category, logo, coverImage
   - Relationships: president, vicePresident, faculty (User refs), members[], events[], gallery[], resources[], forumPosts[]
   - Virtual: memberCount

4. **LostFound Model** (`models/LostFound.js`)
   - Fields: title, description, category, type (lost/found), location, date, images[], contactName, contactPhone, contactEmail, status
   - Relationships: claims[] (with claimedBy User), postedBy (User)
   - Text search index

3. **errorHandler.js** - Centralized error handling

### Controllers
1. **authController.js** - Register, login, getMe, updateDetails, updatePassword, logout

2. **eventController.js** - CRUD operations, register/unregister for events

### Configuration
- **database.js** - MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- **.env** - Environment variables (PORT, MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, etc.)

### 2. Setup MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running:
```bash
# Start MongoDB (Windows)
net start MongoDB

# Or use MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Atlas
```

### 3. Configure Environment

## üìÅ File Upload Structure

```
server/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/         # Event posters
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clubs/          # Club images (gallery)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lost-found/     # Lost & found item images
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profiles/       # User profile pictures
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/      # Club resources (documents)
```

### Upload Limits
- Images: 5MB max
- Documents: 10MB max
- Gallery: Max 10 images per upload
- Lost & Found: Max 5 images per item

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. User registers/logs in
2. Server generates JWT token
3. Token sent in response and stored in httpOnly cookie
4. Client includes token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
5. Protected routes verify token via `protect` middleware
6. Role-based routes check permissions via `authorize` middleware

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Complete Remaining Controllers
You need to create controllers for:
1. `clubController.js`
2. `lostFoundController.js`
3. `announcementController.js`
4. `feedbackController.js`
5. `userController.js`

### Create All Routes
You need to create route files for:
1. `authRoutes.js` ‚úÖ (Pattern provided)
2. `eventRoutes.js`
3. `clubRoutes.js`
4. `lostFoundRoutes.js`
5. `announcementRoutes.js`
6. `feedbackRoutes.js`
7. `userRoutes.js`

### Testing
1. Use Postman or Thunder Client to test API endpoints
2. Test authentication flow
3. Test file uploads
4. Test role-based access control

### Integration with Frontend
1. Update frontend API base URL to `http://localhost:5000/api`
2. Include JWT token in requests
3. Handle file uploads with FormData
4. Update mock data calls with real API calls

## üìù Example API Calls

### Register User
```javascript
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@klh.edu.in",
  "password": "password123",
  "studentId": "2021001",
  "role": "student",
  "department": "CSE",
  "year": 3,
  "phone": "9876543210"
}
```

### Login
```javascript
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@klh.edu.in",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Create Event (with token)
```javascript
POST http://localhost:5000/api/events
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Tech Fest 2025",
  "description": "Annual technology festival",
  "date": "2025-11-15",
  "time": "10:00 AM",
  "venue": "Main Auditorium",
  "category": "Technical",
  "maxCapacity": 500,
  "organizer": "Tech Club",
  "organizerContact": "techclub@klh.edu.in"
}
```
