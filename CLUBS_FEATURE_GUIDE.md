## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management

**Clubs.js:**
```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('all'); // Tab switching
const [registeredClubIds, setRegisteredClubIds] = useState(['1', '3']); // Mock registered clubs
```

**ClubDetail.js:**
```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('forum'); // Tab in detail page
const [forumPosts, setForumPosts] = useState([]); // Forum messages
const [events, setEvents] = useState([]); // Club events
const [gallery, setGallery] = useState([]); // Media items
const [resources, setResources] = useState([]); // Documents
```

### Mock Data

Currently uses localStorage and component state for:
- Registered clubs tracking
- Forum posts
- Event registrations
- Gallery items
- Resources

**When backend is connected:**
- Replace mock data with API calls
