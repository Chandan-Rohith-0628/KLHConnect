- Dynamic navigation items based on user role
- Admin sees all modules + Admin Panel
- Faculty sees limited modules (no Clubs, no Lost & Found)
- Students see all student-facing modules

**Code:**
```javascript
const getNavItems = () => {
  const baseItems = [
    { path: '/dashboard', icon: Home, label: 'Home' },
    { path: '/events', icon: Calendar, label: 'Events' },
    { path: '/announcements', icon: Bell, label: 'Announcements' },
  ];

  if (user?.role === 'admin') {
    return [...baseItems, Lost & Found, Clubs, Feedback, Admin Panel];
  }

  if (user?.role === 'faculty') {
    return [...baseItems, Feedback];
  }

  // Student
  return [...baseItems, Lost & Found, Clubs, Feedback];
};
```

---

### 2. **Clubs Module**
**Files:** 
- `client/src/pages/Clubs/Clubs.js`
- `client/src/pages/Clubs/ClubDetail.js`

#### Admin View:
- ✅ **No tabs** - sees all clubs in one view
- ✅ **"View Details" button** instead of "Join Club"
- ✅ **Members tab** in club detail page showing:
  - Member name, email, role, joined date
  - Table format with sortable columns
- ✅ **Read-only access** to forum posts and events
- ✅ Can view all club content but cannot join or post

#### Student View:
- ✅ **Two tabs**: Campus Clubs | Registered Clubs
- ✅ **"Join Club" button** for unregistered clubs
- ✅ **"Access Club" button** for registered clubs
- ✅ Full interaction: post in forum, register for events

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// Admin sees all clubs without tab filtering
const filteredClubs = clubs.filter(club => {
  if (isAdmin) return true; // No tab filtering
  if (activeTab === 'registered') {
    return registeredClubIds.includes(club._id);
  }
  return true;
});

// Different buttons based on role
{isAdmin ? (
  <Link to={`/clubs/${club._id}`}>View Details</Link>
) : (
  isRegistered ? <Link>Access Club</Link> : <button>Join Club</button>
)}
```

**Members Tab (Admin Only):**
- Shows complete member list with details
- Color-coded roles (President, Admin, Member)
- Joined date for each member

---

### 3. **Feedback Module**
**File:** `client/src/pages/Feedback/Feedback.js`

#### Admin View:

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(isAdmin ? 'all' : 'submit');

// Tab visibility
{isAdmin ? (
  <button>All Feedback</button>
) : (
  <>
    <button>Submit Feedback</button>
    <button>{isFaculty ? 'Review Feedback' : 'Track Status'}</button>
    {isFaculty && <button>All Feedback</button>}
  </>
)}
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Frontend Protection

**1. Conditional Rendering:**
```javascript
const isAdmin = user?.role === 'admin';
const isFaculty = user?.role === 'faculty';

{isAdmin && <AdminOnlyComponent />}
{(isAdmin || isFaculty) && <StaffComponent />}
```

**2. Route Protection:**
```javascript
<Route path="/admin" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <AdminPanel />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

**3. Dynamic Navigation:**
- Navigation items filtered by role
- Hidden routes don't appear in menu

### Backend Requirements (To Implement)

**1. JWT Token with Role:**
```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: user._id, role: user.role },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET
);
```

**2. Role Middleware:**
```javascript
const requireAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Admin access required' });
  }
  next();
};

const requireStaff = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!['admin', 'faculty'].includes(req.user.role)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Staff access required' });
  }
  next();
};
```

**3. Protected Routes:**
```javascript
// Admin only
router.post('/announcements', requireAdmin, createAnnouncement);
router.delete('/announcements/:id', requireAdmin, deleteAnnouncement);
router.get('/clubs/:id/members', requireAdmin, getClubMembers);

// Admin or Faculty
router.get('/feedback/all', requireStaff, getAllFeedback);

// Students only
router.post('/clubs/:id/join', requireStudent, joinClub);
```
